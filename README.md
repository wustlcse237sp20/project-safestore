## Commands to Compile and Run Code:
Note: Do not copy and paste the $, they represent your terminal new lines
Note 2: You will not be able to run this from Eclipse, this is intentional.
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/wustlcse237sp20/project-safestore.git
$ cd project-safestore/
$ ./runSafeStore.sh 
```
